# Shattered Star

This project will become a top-down online multiplayer dungeon crawler built in Unity.

## Features (Work in progress)

- Online co-op for 2â€“4 players (ENet-based networking)
- Holy trinity class structure (Tank, DPS, Healer)
- One dungeon in the MVP with mobs and a boss
- Modular and extensible structure for more dungeons

## Getting Started

1. Open `project.godot` in Godot 4.
2. Run `Main.tscn`.
3. Use `NetworkManager.gd` to host or join a game.
4. Players spawn automatically with `MultiplayerSpawner.gd`.
